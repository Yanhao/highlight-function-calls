* highlight-function-calls

[[https://melpa.org/#/highlight-function-calls][file:https://melpa.org/packages/highlight-function-calls-badge.svg]]

This package highlights function symbols in function calls.  This makes them stand out from other symbols, which makes it easy to see where calls to other functions are.  Optionally, macros and special forms can be highlighted as well.  Also, a list of symbols can be excluded from highlighting; by default, ones like =+= / =-=, =<= / =>=, =error=, =require=, etc. are excluded.  Finally, the =not= function can be highlighted specially.

The default face just underlines the function name, but you can customize the face however you like.

** Screenshots

Here's a plain Emacs configuration:

Here's one with some other highlighting modes, like =rainbow-delimiters= and =rainbow-identifiers=:

** Installation

Install the package from MELPA and you're all set!

If you want to install it manually, put =highlight-function-calls.el= in your =load-path=, then add this to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'highlight-function-calls)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Run =highlight-function-calls-mode= to activate.  Maybe you want to add it to your =emacs-lisp-mode-hook= like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package highlight-function-calls
    :config
    (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'highlight-function-calls-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Tips

You can customize options and faces in the =highlight-function-calls= customization group.
