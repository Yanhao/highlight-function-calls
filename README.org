* highlight-function-calls

[[https://melpa.org/#/highlight-function-calls][file:https://melpa.org/packages/highlight-function-calls-badge.svg]]

This package highlights function symbols in function calls.  This makes them stand out from other symbols, which makes it easy to see where calls to other functions are.  Optionally, macros and special forms can be highlighted as well.  Also, a list of symbols can be excluded from highlighting; by default, ones like =+= / =-=, =<= / =>=, =error=, =require=, etc. are excluded.  Finally, the =not= function can be highlighted specially.

** Screenshots

Here's a plain Emacs configuration:

Here's one with some other highlighting modes, like =rainbow-delimiters= and =rainbow-identifiers=:
